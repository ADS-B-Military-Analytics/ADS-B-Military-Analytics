First of all thank you for considering to contribute, secondly at the moment this is still in development with many things working, however buggy and not "stichted" 
together into one coherent program. At the time of writing the TODOs are as follows.

-Finish backend calculations. Django is planned for the future but to keep it simple it'll remain a desktop app for now.
-Add a GUI. I'm not a designer so I'll be using the customtkinter and then electron as I learn javascript.
