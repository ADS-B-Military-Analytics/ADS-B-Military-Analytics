First of all thank you for considering to contribute, secondly at the moment this is still in development with many things working, however buggy and not "stichted" 
together into one coherent program. At the time of writing the TODOs are as follows.

-Finish implementing Django (At the moment a basic local host setup, basic HTML files for testing, and the first round of url routing has been completed)
-Create frontend
