This is a road map for how this app will be deployed. 

Right now at the time of writing which is 1/28/23 the backend is essentially complete. It fetchs data from the ADSB Exchange API, formats it, removes dupilcates and irrelevant data
and then uploads that data to MongoDB every day at midnight. 

Thats the server side that I hope to run on Google Cloud eventually or AWS.
Then with a function you can call that array from that day and store it into a "cache" (just stores it locally for the desktop version) for later usage.

My current plan right now to create a desktop app then move to a web version later.
