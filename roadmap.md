T**his is a road map for how this app will be developed and deployed:**

As of 2/5/23 backend is still in development with progress being steadily made. The latest update (Data update 4) contained a large amount of changes, bugfixes, and optimizations. More backend features will come later in development but before the development of the frontend 2 analytic features will be included. Sorting of aircraft by count, and flagging interesting aircraft based on aircraft type, whether they are an emergency, or based on its callsign. Sorting aircraft based on callsign is done except for bugfixes. Interesting aircraft code is mostly done except for selecting which way you want to find the interesting aircraft as well as error handling for said function.

After this is resolved the frontend will be made with Electron to help transition those skills to a web version.
